##A New Way Of Shopping

Imagine an app that could allow you to take a photo of a product or its barcode while you're in a store, compare it to prices online and purchase if you found it cheaper. Sounds simple enough, right? Plenty of online services can ship to your house if you know what you're looking for. But what if you didn't know until you came across it?

The art of store browsing no longer has a drawback. Use the app, recognize the product by barcode or image, and let us handle the rest so that you can save money and go about your day.

###Future Projections
Additional functionality to purchase items in-store and foregoing traditional checkout to be added later, so stay tuned for the updates!
